This piece is a starry window.

Growing up I have always loved starry skies of different shades of blues, purples and pinks so it only felt right
to create something of the same style. 

I started off with a purple base on the background, then I overlayed two rects of different shades, the top rect being
a deeper purple and the bottom rect being a lighter pink. I then applied the blur filter to blend these shades together.
This creates a gradient effect similar to how the sky looks when the sun is still illuminating the horizon. 

I then created randomized stars that change with each time you load the program - the stars are randomised, inspired by
the following p5js sketch by Jesse Harding:

I initially didn't want the stars to be randomized, but I'm not sure if it's possible to create assigned coordinates for each individual star without having to store hundreds of separate coordinates which I didn't exactly want to do, so the
randomness ended up being a part of my project. This wasn't exactly a negative thing however.
I feel that randomness adds a uniqueness to the piece, indicating that the sky will never look exactly identical to the last time you saw it. It in a way shows how each view outside the window is a unique and special one, and that something will always be different, even in the slightest way.

I tried to add dimension to the window frame by creating rects that depict light casting on the rim of the frame,
illuminating the dark room with the brightness of the starry sky outside, and I feel it was quite effective. 

It felt too plain to have a simple starry sky, so I decided to add a shooting star using a mix of triangles and 
curves. I played with opacity to create a glowing effect on the trail of the star.

Finally I created a cursor image in Aseprite and imported it to replace the cursor. I drew a star for the cursor which I feel matches the overall aesthetic of the piece and adds an extra level of immersion with the environment.
