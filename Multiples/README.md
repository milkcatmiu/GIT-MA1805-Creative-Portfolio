This piece allows the user to choose between three word prompts and it adds the word to the word bank.
For starters, the program is supposed to visually type out each new word with the typewriter effect 
which I coded with the help of the sketch by Pippin Barr:

However the typewriter effect doesn't work consistently for some reason, and only works if you quickly add many words to the word bank array.

To create the words choices, I created several arrays containing 50 words surrounding each theme. The themes are desserts, colours, animals, plants and nature. I used ChatGPT and the internet to help me come up with 50 words for each theme as I could only come up with so many by myself. 

I then coded for the program to randomly generate three words from any of these themes, with a total of 300 possible words that could generate. The user can then select whichever word they like most and it will add it to the list. 

This program was a very simple one but in a way acts as a way for the user to express themself by choosing the things they like the most out of the three. The program ultimately shows that you can express yourself through the things you like or even dislike, proving how broad self expression can truly be.
