COLLISIONS

This piece plays with colour and collision, taking two circles of two random colours and 
colliding them with a colourful exploding firework using the colour that results when mixing the 
two base colours of the circles.

My code started off with playing with moving squares and distance - I didn't really know where to go with the
concept of collision, but upon browsing online and playing around with the code, I decided I wanted to make two circles collide and form a new colour in the middle. 

I wasn't sure how to go about it first, and it initially only created a new circle in the middle that slowly
increased in size until it reached the edge of the canvas. I found this was kind of boring and I didn't feel it
was meaningful enough. This is where the fireworks came in. - I was inspired by Daniel Shiffman's Fireworks p5js sketch:
(https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/O2M0SO-WO)
and decided I liked the explosion effect, attempting to recreate it myself. I wanted the collision aspect to be 
more powerful and creating the firework explosion put emphasis on their collision.

To improve the overall design, I decided to make a background photo. 
The background is a photo that I took in my kitchen when I lived in halls last year, which
I filtered to be more blue, dark and visually subtle in order to make the 'fireworks' on the foreground using 
both Procreate and Photoshop. 

At the top of the screen are the words 'two worlds collide'. The piece overall represents the 
effect when two people meet and fall in love - their worlds essentially collide and everything changes. 
Something new and amazing is made and you create so many new memories, the explosion of colour 
representing a big-bang like explosion of new memories and feelings that emerge when someone special
enters your life. 

A lot of my feelings behind this piece stem from my personal experiences, my main muse being my boyfriend.
When someone shows you that much love and care, it changes your whole world and opens up so many doors that
you never even knew existed. With this piece, I wanted to capture that exciting burst of new feelings and 
memories that come with meeting the right person. Each new pair of colourful circles is like another couple
in the world - there are endless stories of love and commitment in the world and it's beautiful when you picture
every couple's story as one collective firework show.
