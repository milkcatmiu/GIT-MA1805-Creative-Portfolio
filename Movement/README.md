This piece reflects how negative experiences and trauma changes you as a person. Each droplet represents a tear shed when
something bad happens to you, and with every time a drop hits the ground, the girl changes, similar to how you change as a 
person through the things you experience in life.

I drew the girl who I nicknamed 'Rainy Girl' in procreate, then I created multiple versions by applying filters and drawing
new different facial expressions. I applied filters such as halftone and glitch effects using procreate, and the heavily distorted images are representative of losing yourself in your feelings. 

The background is a picture I took of the sky outside of my house, which I then filtered to be darker and more deeper in colour.

The visual raindrops were inspired by this p5js sketch by user zygugi:

And I sourced the raindrop sound effects from freesound at:
https://freesound.org/people/giddster/sounds/387949/

I then edited the raindrop sound effects in audacity, separating them and changing the speed and pitch of the droplets.

After splitting it into different drop sound effects, it plays a random droplet effect every time it drops on the ground. 

I don't like how the raindrops don't consistently drop from the top of the screen, but this is because of the raindrop spawn limit which I intentionally kept small as I didn't want it to spam raindrop audio.

To finish off the piece, I added the text 'I feel myself changing each time', reflective of the changes you see in yourself
each time you suffer.
