This piece is a collection of different photos and videos that I took recently, with descriptions of 
their date, location and some thoughts associated with them. 

The majority of my photos focus on the sky and nature as I always tend to take photos of the sky, clouds
and sunsets during my outings. 

This piece reflects the peace I have found in life lately, the selection of images being from times in my life
where I felt happy with where I was. I find that it's important to value these moments in life, as it's easy
to get lost in your own sadness and struggles.

I didn't find the coding aspect too difficult as the majority of the code is cycling through arrays, however
it was difficult working with asset creation:

I took the photos on my iPhone and they originally are created in a very large resolution. 
I edited my photos in Procreate and Photoshop, applying the halftone filter and different effects to create a more
digital look to the photos, similar to that of early 2000s graphics. 
However when I exported these photos they were HUGE (around 10-20mb each) and I ended up needing to resize them
and compress the data. This resulted in me using JPEG files, which usually would be a problem due to lossy compression 
but it didn't matter as low quality images suited the overall retro aesthetic of my media piece.

The same issue occured with the video files - I didn't filter them as I wasn't sure how to apply visual filters and
didn't want to spend too much time on assets as time management is not my strongest suit. I used Premier Pro to resize
the images to a smaller resolution and similarly greatly compressed their size. 

For the click sound effect, I recorded the clicking of my mouse using my iPhone's voice notes app and converted the
.m4a files into mp3 files. I made some tweaks to the sfx in Audacity, filtering out the background white noise, 
increasing the speed of the click and raising the pitch slightly. 

I created a background by taking a screenshot of my taskbar on my computer and applying different filters and colour changes
to suit a pinkish theme. I then used the same colours to create a top bar too. I then layed these on top of a picture
I took of some clouds and applied a blur filter in Photoshop. I originally didn't blur the background but it looked too
visually overwhelming, so blurring the background put a lot of emphasis on the foreground elements.

I found coding each different screen wasn't too difficult for me as I had experience making different screens of a program
from making a game in pycharm when I was in sixth form, so the programming concepts were not challenging for me.

I did however struggle a bit with loading the videos as I forgot that you had to hide the element and redraw the videos
as images.
